# AustinPetsBulletin
A (not nearly yet finished) app designed to create an easily searchable database pulled from data.austintexas.gov. The end goal is to help pet-owners find pets picked up by the city and taken to the Austin Animal Center.

Currently, this app only reads in a test JSON file I've set aside on my cs lab machine and displays its entries in a list (in awful formatting, due to the SDK behind the API not playing nice with Gradle).

Future iterations of the project will include a Google Maps interface that will allow users to see through pins where stray animals have been picked up, as well as a search/filter feature.

If time permits it (but it probably will not) I'd also like to set up my own database that records entries users can put themselves to register missing pets that haven't been picked up.

Even further beyond that, if possible I'd like to incorporate a tip system so that folks who find and return lost pets could get a slight reward. This idea has to be thought out carefully if implemented.

The wireframe has iPhones, but this is an Android project.
